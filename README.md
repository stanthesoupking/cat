# cat
Intentionally re-invented the wheel by creating a file concatenating program in C 🐱

To compile, type the following from inside the source code's root directory:
```bash
make
```

To run just type
```bash
./cat
```

Followed by whatever arguments you would like to use. The command structure looks like this:
```bash
cat <input-file1>, <input-file2>, <...> [-o <output-file>] [--help]
```
